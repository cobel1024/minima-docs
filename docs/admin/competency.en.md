# Competency

!!! note "NCS Competency Framework"

    Minima LMS has built-in NCS (Korean Competency Standards).

    The Classification model contains 1,478 NCS job classifications across 4 levels.
    The final classification level is linked to 13,343 job skills (Skill model).
    Each skill contains 47,374 components (Factor model).

    Learners can set goals by selecting categories and skill factors.
    Once goals are set, Minima LMS recommends pathways to learners.
    (However, the pathway feature is currently not operational due to lack of content.)

    Skills and skill factors are also linked to certificates and badges.
    Through the certificates and badges learners receive, coverage towards their goals can be measured.
