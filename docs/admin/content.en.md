!!! note "Content Access Control"

    In Minima LMS, all content requires enrollment to access.
    Enrollment is managed in the "Learning" app.
    Content without enrollment can be searched but detailed content cannot be accessed.
    As an exception, media content can be set to "Public Access", 
    allowing logged-in learners to view content immediately after searching.

!!! note "Learning Time Tracking"

    Playback time is calculated in seconds to create a bitmap, and actually watched sections are saved as 1.
    Stored as varbit in the database and transmitted over network compressed with gzip.
