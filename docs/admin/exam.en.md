# Exam

!!! note "Exam Full Workflow"

    - Exams are randomly generated from the question bank based on configured question types and quantities.
    - Exam attempts are limited to the number of times configured in the exam settings.
    - When retaking, previous records are not deleted but kept with inactive status.
    - Multiple choice and numeric input types are automatically graded, while text input and essay types require instructor grading.
    - Once grading is complete, change status to 'Complete' to publish results to learners and start the objection period.
    - After the objection period ends, change grading to 'Confirmed' to complete the exam process.
