!!! note "Exam Full Workflow"

    - Exam questions are randomly selected from the question pool based on configured question types and numbers.
    - Students can attempt the exam up to the number of times set in the exam settings.
    - When retaking, previous records are not deleted but kept with inactive status.
    - Multiple choice and numeric input types are automatically graded, while text input and essay types require instructor grading.
    - Once grading is complete, it must be changed to 'Complete' status to be published to learners and start the appeal period.
    - After the appeal period ends, changing the grade to 'Finalized' completes the exam process.
