!!! note "Micro Learning"

    Minima LMS allows learning objects to be used directly 
    or included in a course for learning. It is designed to reuse 
    a single learning object in multiple ways.

!!! warning "Learning Record Tracking"

    When reusing the same learning object in multiple ways, there is a problem 
    of whether to view the learning record as a single record or as a separate 
    record for each location. Minima LMS stores and tracks learning records 
    separately for each location, completely isolating them.
